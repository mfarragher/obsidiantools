# Sussudio

Another word with absolutely no meaning 😄

This will be a note inside the vault dir.  Others will be lipsum in a subdirectory.

![[Sussudio.mp3]]

The song has been compared to the Prince's "1999" ( #y1982 ) <- oh look, a tag!

![[1999.flac]]

More tags:
- #y_1982
- #y-1982
- #y1982/sep
- #y2000/party-over/oops/out-of-time

However these shouldn't be recognised as tags:
- (#y1985 )
- #1985
- [[American Psycho (film)#Patrick Bateman]]
- \#hash_char_not_tag

```python
# #code_comment_not_tag
# #code-comment-not-tag

if '#i_just_say_the_word':
    print('It feels so good')
```
